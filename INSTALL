Once you have SBT, you can compile Jeeves:

Run sbt update to pull in the necessary dependencies.
Run sbt compile to compile.
Once you installed, you can run sbt test to run the tests.
Run the tests by running sbt test.
Linux
The Linux installation should be fairly straightforward as long as you are using a version of Z3 3.2 or later and either putting the binary in the /opt/z3 directory or setting your smt.home variable appropriately.

Windows
Download Scala 2.10.0.
Download Cygwin. Make sure wget, chmod, and major defaults are installed.
Add Cygwin to path.
Download Z3.
Go to http://z3.codeplex.com/
Download the Z3 version 3.2 zip file.
Unzip the internal z3-xxx-xx folder and store to a temporary location
Copy/Move the contents of z3-xxx-xx from temporary download location and to Cygwin/.../opt/z3.
Download SBT build tool, version 0.10.0 or above.
Install Mercurial. Recommended to use the msi that "needs admin rights to install," InnoSetup, or TortoiseHg.
Use Cygwin to navigate to the jeeveslib
Mac
These instructions are for OSX 10.7+.

Install Wine using MacPorts
Prerequisites:
Apple Xcode/XQuartz After installation be sure to install command line tools: go to Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads.
Java Development Package (Detailed Instructions)
Install MacPorts by downloading the compatible ".dmg" package.
Configure MacPorts:
Open a terminal and copy paste the following code into it:
echo export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:\$PATH$'\n'export MANPATH=/opt/local/man:\$MANPATH | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
If MacPorts was installed properly then you should see as a response the following code; if not then the Admin Account does not have a password set which is required.
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
export MANPATH=/opt/local/man:$MANPATH
Next, run the following command:
if [ `sysctl -n hw.cpu64bit_capable` -eq 1 ] ; then echo "+universal" | sudo tee -a /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf; else echo "not 64bit capable"; fi
The terminal should respond with +universal.
Next, run the following code to accept the Xcode license:
sudo xcodebuild -license
Quit and reopen the terminal.
Install Wine using MacPorts:
This part will can take a really long time depending on the speed of your computer. It will take approximately 1-2 hours, so you can walk away and do something else in the meantime; eat, play video game, read, etc. Note: if after running the following command, Terminal complains about not finding 'make' then you probably did not install Xcode/XQuartz properly and should refer to step 1.2.
sudo xcodebuild -license
Run the following two commands to ensure the D-Bus is running properly:
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist

Installing Z3 SMT Solver for Mac OSX:
Navigate to http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/old/older_z3.html and download the preferred ".msi" file.
Open Terminal, if it is not already, and move the file from Downloads/ to your desired directory and use the msiexec wine command to install z3.
wine msiexec name_of_file.msi
Create executable:
If you have not already, make a ~/opt/z3/bin/ directory and cd into it.
With your preferred editor, open a new file and name it z3.
Inside, paste the following instructions:
args=`echo $* | sed -e 's|/|\\\|g'`
export WINEDEBUG=fixme-all
exec wine ~/.wine/drive_c/bin/z3.exe $args
Type chmod a+x z3 in order to make the file executable by all users, groups and others.
Test that z3 was correctly installed by checking ./z3 -version.
MacPort Mercurial & sbt:
sbt:
sudo port install sbt
Mercurial:
sudo port install mercurial +bash_completion
If these two options do not work properly than you can download Homebrew and install mercurial and sbt with the following commands:
brew update
brew install sbt
brew install mercurial
